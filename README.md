# Work-from-home-study-case

## Overview

Here is a little personal project that I made. I create an online survey and shared among my coworkers on Work From Home topic. The scope was to see how many prefer working from home instead from the office, the reasons behind and more.
## Tehnical stuff
The project was done in Excel because the company was a small one with only 12 employees (myself included) and I think it was the perfect oportunity to test and polish my skills in terms of cleaning the data and visualisations.
